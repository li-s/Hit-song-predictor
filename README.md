# Hit-song-predictor
Predicting whether a song will be popular

In this project we will aim to create a model which best predicts if a hit song will be popular. The
different models testes will be in the ```model``` folder, and the data used is in the ```data``` folder.
The best model is adaboost with test accuracy 85%, and the best indicator of a popular song is "instrumentalness".

# Usage
Run ```python model.py```, where "model" is one of the many models in the ```model``` folder to
train the model on the data, and output test results.
